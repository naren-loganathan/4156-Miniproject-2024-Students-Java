Bugs fixed during unit testing/reading code:

 - [Course] Constructor - set enrolled student count to 0 instead of 500 (consistent with the javadoc)
 - [Course] isCourseFull - fixed incorrect condition
 - [Course] enrollStudent - add condition to check for available space
 - [Course] dropStudent - add condition to check if a student is enrolled before dropping
 - [Course] getCourseLocation & getInstructorName - return values swapped
